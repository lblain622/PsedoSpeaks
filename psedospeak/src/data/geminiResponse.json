  "input": "The audio requests pseudocode for implementing a jump instruction in assembly language.",
  "output": "```\nBEGIN\n  GET jump_address  //Obtain the memory address to jump to.  This could be a label or a calculated address.\n  SET instruction_pointer TO jump_address //Update the instruction pointer to the new address.\nEND\n```",
  "variables": [
    "* jump_address",
    "* instruction_pointer"
  ],
  "feedback": "The pseudocode is very high-level.  It needs more detail to be truly useful.  For example, it omits how `jump_address` is obtained (e.g., from a label lookup table, direct calculation). It also simplifies the instruction pointer update; in reality, this process might involve more steps depending on the specific assembly architecture.  Error handling (e.g., what if `jump_address` is invalid?) is also absent.  More robust pseudocode would include these considerations."
