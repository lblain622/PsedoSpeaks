  "input": "Generate pseudocode for a FizzBuzz program in Java.",
  "output": "```\nStart\n  For each number from 1 to 100:\n    If number is divisible by 3 and 5:\n      Print \"FizzBuzz\"\n    Else if number is divisible by 3:\n      Print \"Fizz\"\n    Else if number is divisible by 5:\n      Print \"Buzz\"\n    Else:\n      Print the number\n  End For\nEnd\n```",
  "variables": [
    "* number"
  ],
  "feedback": "The pseudocode is clear and concise, accurately reflecting the core logic of the FizzBuzz problem.  However, it could benefit from explicitly stating the data type of the `number` variable (e.g., integer) for improved clarity, although this is often implicit in pseudocode.  Adding a more robust error handling mechanism (although unlikely needed for this specific problem) would make it more complete."
